## The Millionaire Next Door - Thomas Stanley and William Danko
* Common denominators among those who successfully build wealth:
  * Live below their means
  * Allocate time, money, and energy, in ways conducive to building wealth
  * Financial independence is more important than displaying high social status
  * Parents do not provide economic outpatient care
  * Their adult children are economically self-sufficient
  * Proficient in targeting market opportunities
  * Chose the right occupation
  
* **Wealthy (Definition)**: One who gets more pleasure from owning substantial amounts of appreciable assets than from displaying a high-consumption lifestyle

* **Expected Net worth** = (Age x Pretax annual income / 10)

* Great offense: Earn High; Great Defense: Accumulate High (Frugal)

  The way to outperform is through great defense, and this is possible through budgeting and planning (time and energy).

* **Strategy for nunbudgeter millionaires**: Create an environment of relative scarcity i.e invest from their annual before they pay the sellers for their food, clothes, home, credit, etc.

* To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income, and maximize your unrealized income (wealth / capital appreciation without a cash flow)

* Never purchase a home with a mortgage that is more than 2x your household's annual realized income

* Begin earning and investing early in your adult life

* Wealth is more often the result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and, most of all, self-discipline

* Choose a financial advisor who is endorsed by an enlightened accountant and/or his clients with investment portfolios that in the long run outpace the market. If you don’t have an accountant, hire one. To find a high-quality accountant, ask friends or associates who fit the PAW profile. You may wish to call the accounting department at your state’s university. Speak with several accounting faculty. Ask them for the names of their former students who have established track records in helping clients make enlightened financial decisions. Another method is to call the local offices of national accounting firms, which are often very selective in their hiring. Even large firms have many smaller accounting/financial planning clients. We selected our CPAs based on two criteria. First, the CPAs were recommended by professors of accounting. Second, the CPAs were initially hired out of college by major accounting firms and later started their own successful accounting firms. We find that many of the very best CPAs and financial planners follow this career path.

## The Happiness Advantage - Shawn Achor

* Cultivating positive brains makses us more motivated, efficient, resilient, creative, and productive, which drives performance upward

* If we study merely what is average, we will remain merely average. Don't make the error of the average i.e don't always try and get to the average. This links to not removing the outliers, and rather learn from them.

* What we spend our time and mental energy focusing on can indeed become our reality

* Brains are hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative or neutral, but when they are positive

* Seven principles that predict success and achievement
  * **The Happiness Advantage**: Positive brains have more biological advantage over negative or neutral brains
  
  * **The Fulcrum and the Lever**: The way we experience the world, and the ability to succeed in it changes based on our         mindset. This principle teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (lever) to be     more fulfilled and successful.
  
  * **The Tetris Effect**: When our brain gets stuck in a pattern that focuses on stress, negativity, and failure, we set     
    ourselves to fail. This principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to spot patters of posibility, so we can seize the
    opportunities around us.
    
  * **Falling Up**: This principle is about finding the mental path that not only leads us up out of failure or suffering, 
    but teaches us to be happier and more successful because of it.
     
  * **The Zorro Circle**: When challenges loom and we get overwhelmed, our rational brains can get hijacked by emotions. This
    principle teaches us how to regain control by focusing first on small, manageable goals, and then gradually expanding our
    circles to achieve bigger and bigger ones.
     
  * **The 20-second Rule**: Sustaining lasting change often feels impossible since our willpower is limited. When our 
    willpower fails, we fall back to out old habits, and succumb to the path of least resistance. This principle shows, how
    by making small energy adjustments, we can reroute the path of least resistance and replace bad habits with good ones.
     
  * **Social Investment**: In the midst of challenges and stress, we choose to hunker down and retreat within ourselves. 
    However, the most successful people invest in their friends, peers and family members to propel themselves forward. This 
    principle teaches us how to invest more in one of the greates predictors of success and excellence - our social support 
    network.

* Happiness is not a belief that we don't need to change, it is the realization that we can

* Don't look at happiness as some distant reward for achievements. Rather, capitalize on the positive and reap the rewards at 
  every turn.
  
* Happiness is the joy we feel striving after our potential
 
* Positive emotions flood our brains with dopamine and serotonin, chemicals that not only make us feel good, but dial up the 
  learning centers of our brains to higher levels. It helps us organize new information, keep that info in the brain longer,
  and retrieve it faster
   
* **Medical anchoring**: Occurs when a doctor has trouble letting go of an initial diagonosis (anchor point), even in the 
  face of new information that contradicts the initial theory.
  
* Positive emotions provide a quick and powerful antidote to stress and anxiety, which in turn improves our focus and our 
  ability to function at the best level.
  
* **Some ways to put yourself in a positive mindset**:
  * Meditate
  * Find something to look forward to
  * Commit conscious acts of kindness
  * Infuse positivity in your surroundings
  * Exercise
  * Spend money on doing and not having
  * Exercise a signature strength
  
* Sacrificing positivity in the name of time management and efficiency actually slows us down

* **Some ways to spread positive mindset**:
  * Talk about someone in the company who deserves recognition (Basically words of appreciation make a huge difference)
  * A small token of appreciation from one person to another
  
* The mental contruction of our faily activities, more than the activity itself, defines our reality

* Believe in your abilities, and focus on your strengths when assigned a challenging task

* Scanning the world for negatives undercuts our creativity, raises our stress levels, and lowers the motivation and ability
  to accomplish goals
  
* Perform the *Three Good Things* Exercise daily

* **Counterfact**: An alternate scenario our brain creates to help us evaluate and make sense of what really happened

* Learn the ABCD (Adversity, Belief, Consequence, Disputation)

* Activation energy is the initial spark needed to catalyze a reaction. The same energy, both physical and mental is needed 
  of people to overcome inertia and kick-start a positive habit. Otherwise, we end up going down on a path of least  
  resistance.
  
* Lower the activation energy for the habits that you want to adobt, and raise it for the ones you want to avoid. The more we 
  lower the activation energy for our desired actions, the more we enhance our ability to jump-start positive change.
  
* Studies show that the more team members are encouraged to socialize and interact face-to-face, the more engaged they feel, 
  the more energy they have, and the longer they can stay focused on a task.
  
## Atomic Habits - James Clear

* A habit is a routine or a behavior performed regularly, and in many cases automatically

* Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results when you stick with them for years

* You get what you repeat

* Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your 
  ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
  
* Habits need to persist long enough to break the Plateau of Latent Potential, in which the initial growth is very slow, and 
  once you cross the threshold, you see remarkable results.
  
* Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are the processes that lead to those results.

* Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are good for making progress.

* Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves

* The purpose of goals is to win the game. The purpose of systems is to keep playing the game. True long-term thinking is 
  goal-less thinking. It is a cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.
  
* You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

* Changing habits is challenging because:
  * We try to change the wrong thing
  * We try to change our habits in the wrong way

![Three Layers of Behavior Change](Images/Three-Layers-of-Behavior-Change.png)
* Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
  
* Improvements are only temporary until they become a part of who you are i.e of your identity.

* Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version requires you to edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your  
  identity.
  
* New identities require new evidence. It is a 2-step process:
  * Decide the type of person you want to be
  * Prove it to yourself with small wins
  
* Habits are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.

* Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. Habits get done automatically, and gives us more mental space to focus on new challenges.

* Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud make the consequences seem more real.

* Best way to start a new habit:
  * Implementation intention: Plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. (With a particular time and location)
  * Habit stacking: Identify a current habit you do each day, and then stack your new behavior on top of it. (With a  
    particular current habit)

## Zero to One - Peter Theil

* Horizontal progress (Globalization): Copying things that work.

* Vertical progress (Technology): Doing new things.

* In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.

* A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

* Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

* What a startup needs to do? - Question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.

* First step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.

* Some principles that might work:
  * Better to risk boldness than triiviality.
  * A bad plan is better than no plan.
  * Competitive markets destroy profits.
  * Sales matters just as much as product.
  
* Don't ignore the dogmas of the past. Think about the past mistakes and think for yourself.

* If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business.

* Competitive firms try to showcase themselves as a monopoly (Try to define their market as **intersection** of smaller markets).
  Monpolists try to showcase themselves as being in competition to avoid scrutinization (Try to frame their market as **union** of several markets).
  
* Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. The are not just good for society; the are powerful 
  engines for making it better.

* Monopoly is the condition for a successful business. All happy companies are different; Each have a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies
  are the same; they failed to escape competition.
  
* A great tech busiiness iis defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future.

* Characteristics of Monopoly:
  * **Proprietary Technology**: It must be atleast 10x better than its closest substitute in some important dimension. The clearest way to make > 10x improvement
    is to invent something completely new.
  * **Network Effects**: It makes a product more useful as more people use it. Start small and then scale. The perfect target market for a startup is a small
    group of people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Post this, expand into related and slightly broader markets. As you craft a plan 
    to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.
  * **Economies of Scale**: Fixed costs of creating a product can be spread out over greater quantities of sales.
  * **Branding**

![Four Views](Images/Four_Views.jpg)
* A definite view favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity, a definite person decides the one best thing to do and then does it.
**Definite Optimism**: Envision and do it.
**Definite Pessimism**: Copy without expecting anything new.
**Indefinite Pessimism**: Self-fulfilling; Slacker with low expectations.
**Indefinite Optimism**: Some progress without planning.

* To increase discretionary spending, we would need definite plans to solve specific problems.

* In startups, intelligent design works best.

* Lean way of starting is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to things that already exist might lead to a local maximum, not a global maximum.

* **The Power Law**: A small handful of companies radically outperform all others. If you focus on diversification instead of pursuit of the very few companies that can become overwhelmingly valuable, you will miss out on those rare companies in the first place.
  * Only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund. This is scary because it eliminates the vast majority of possible
    investments.
  * The one who understands the power law will make as few investments as possible (Diversification is not always a strength)
  
* **Secrets**: There still are hidden problems that we need to identify, and solve. If there are many secrets, there are many world changing companies yet to be 
  started.
    * Four social trends have made us root out our belief in secrets:
      * Incrementalism: We tend to do only a bit incremental work on top of already existing work.
      * Risk Aversion: The prospect of taking the risk and being lonely but right is scary. The prospect of being lonely and wrong is unbearable.
      * Compacency: We try to reap the benefits of the past.
      * Flatness: With globalization, we think that everyone has access to everything. If it were possible to discover something new, someone in some corner
        of the world has already done it.
        
    * To say there are no secrets left would mean that we live in a world with no hidden injustice. Slavery was once considered normal until it was identified 
      as an injustice.
      
    * In economics, disbileif in screts leads to faith in efficient markets. However, this leads to a bubble and ultimately the market crashes.
    
    * There are many more secrets, and will yield to only relentless searchers.
    
    * Two kinds of secrets: **Secrets of nature** and **Secrets about people** +
      When thinking of what kind of company to build, ask yourself:
      1. What secrets is nature not telling you?
      2. What secrets are people not telling you?
  
* **Foundations**:

  * Technical abilities and compelmentary skill sets of co-founders matter, but how well they work together matter just as much. They should have a prehistory 
    before they start a company together.
    
  * Useful to distinguish between:
    * Ownership (Who legally owns a company's equity?): In a startup, usually the founders, employees, and investors.
    * Possession (Who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?): In a startup, it is the employees.
    * Control (Who formally governs the company's affairs?): In a startup, usually the Board of Directors comprising of founders and investors.
    
  * If you want an effective board, keep it small. For a private company, a board of three is ideal. It should never exceed five. For public companies, the average
    is nine members.
    
  * For a venture backed startup, a low pay CEO is what is desired. Any cash is more about short term (present) rather than long term (future). This is because
    once we have cash in hand, we can do anything at that moment, and don't try to create new value for the company in the future.
    
  * The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention that is most characteristic of its beginnings. Keep being born by creating new things.
  
* If you want someone to join your company, tell them about your mission and team.

* Superior sales and distributiion by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation. However, the opposite is not true.

* Humans and Computers together could achieve better than either of them alone.

* Seven questions that every company must answer:
  * The Engineering Question: Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
  * The Timing Question: Is now the right time to start your particular business?
  * The Monopoly Question: Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
  * The People Question: Do you have the right team?
  * The Distribution Question: Do you have a way to not just create but to deliver the product?
  * The Durability Question: Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
  * The Secret Question: Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
  
* An entrepreneur can't benefit from macro-scale insights unless his own plans begin at the micro-scale.

* Start small. Become big in a small market, and then scale.

* Four possible patterns for future of humanity:
  * Recurrent collapse: Alternation between prosperity and ruin (Ups and Downs).
  * Plateau: We were reach a plateau, and the future will be same as the present. (Stagnation can lead to extinction because of heavy competition).
  * Extinction: We will rise up and then fall so hard that we won't be able to recover.
  * Takeoff: Accelerating takeoff towards a much better future. The breakthrough could take a number of forms.
  
## Bogleheads Guide to Investing - Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, Michael Lebouf

* Rule of 72: Divide 72 by the annual return rate to know the time in which the money will be doubled. Eg: 9% annual return wiill double in 72 / 9 = 8 years.

* Borrow funds when the expected payoff is higher than the cost of borrowing.

## Extreme Ownership

* Be humble and take responsibility for your failures. Leaders make no excuses. They develop solutions and solve problems.

* Prioritize and Execute.

* As a leader, it is not what you preach, it is what you tolerate.

* There are no bad teams, it is only bad leaders.

* In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a _true believer_ in the mission.

* The leader must explain not just what to do, but why.

## I Too Had a Dream - Dr. Verghese Kurien

* Personal integrity is being honest to yourself. If you are honest to yourself, it does not take much effort to be honest with others.

* In living this privilege called ‘Life’, you must accept responsibility for yourself, always use your talents to the best of your ability and contribute somehow to the common good. That common good will present itself to you in many forms every day. If you just look around you, you will find there is a lot waiting to be done.

* I hope that you, too, will discover, as I did, that failure is not about not succeeding. Rather, it is about not putting in your best effort and not contributing, however modestly, to the common good.

* If we are brave enough to love, strong enough to rejoice in another’s happiness and wise enough to know that there is enough to go around for all, then we would have lived our lives to the fullest.

* You cannot get away from the past – even if it is in cast iron – so when you melt down cast iron and make it into something else, its past exists even in the face of apparent change.

* I saw that when you work merely for your own profit, the pleasure is transitory; but if you work for others, there is a deeper sense of fulfilment and if things are handled well, the money, too, is more than adequate.

* I grew with the cooperative and learnt new lessons. One of my first experiences was to learn that within every challenge there is an opportunity.

* Tribhuvandas, Dalaya and I soon came to be known as the Kaira Cooperative’s ‘triumvirate’. Each one of us was distinctly different in manners and skills. Perhaps an organisation needs a mix at its helm. Together we were able to propel the cooperative forward rapidly. It is not that we never disagreed. We did, but each had such a tremendous respect for the integrity and the strength of the other two that all disagreements were resolved privately and maturely without allowing our shared vision to ever swerve from the larger cause.

* We learnt another useful lesson: with adequate support, confrontation at the right time pays off.

* From the very beginning I was convinced that a cooperative, too, must be a business enterprise and it has to run as a business enterprise. If a cooperative forgets this, it will fail; it will collapse. I ensured from the start, therefore, that Amul always operated as a business enterprise – but at all times keeping in mind that the business was to maximise the price paid for the milk, not in order to maximise the dividend, as is the case in the private sector. We did this by manufacturing value-added products which allowed us to give farmers a higher milk price every year.

* What then was the Kaira Cooperative? It was certainly not only about milk. It was very soon becoming an instrument of social and economic change in our rural system. It was evolving into a programme that involved our farmers in their own development. This I learnt very early on through my years of working closely with Tribhuvandas and the farmers of Kaira district: true development is not development of a cow or buffalo but development of women and men. However, you cannot develop women and men until and unless you place the instruments of development in their hands, involve them in the process of such development and create structures that they themselves can command. What, therefore, is a government at its best? It is a government that ‘governs’ least and instead finds ways to mobilise the energies of our people.

* There is nothing wrong in building flyovers in Delhi. What is not fair is when we do not also build an approach road to villages across the nation. There is nothing wrong in having fountains with coloured lights in the capital. After all, Delhi should be beautiful. But it is unjustified when we have not provided drinking water to all our villages. There is nothing wrong in having a modern, private hospital in Bombay, or the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, or other large medical institutions in our big cities. But it is not justified when we have not arranged to have two drops of a medicine put into the eyes of a farmer’s newborn baby, and that baby goes blind. While this would have cost us nothing, we have preferred to spend crores of rupees in building five-star hospitals in cities. Why does this happen? Because policy making is in our hands – in the hands of the elite – and naturally, even unconsciously perhaps, when we make policies we make policies that suit us; we usurp the resources of this land somewhat shamelessly to benefit ourselves. The most charitable interpretation of it is that we do it unconsciously. 

* In every crisis, if you look carefully, you will spot an opportunity. My insistence on finding and seizing that opportunity has often been a source of annoyance for many of my colleagues because it means that unlike most people, I never try to sidestep a crisis. Rather, the more monstrous the crisis, the more I am tempted to rush at it, grasp it by the horns and manoeuvre it until it gives me what I want.

* Our proposal envisaged in detail how the European surpluses were to be used to speed up India’s dairy development. In a nutshell, our approach involved three basic steps. The first was that the donated milk products would be reconstituted, in order to provide the Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras liquid milk schemes with enough milk to obtain a commanding share of their markets. Next, the funds realised from this reconstitution and sale of donated products were to be used to resettle city-kept cattle and help them to breed and to increase organised milk production, its procurement and processing. Finally, this entire operation would be directed towards stabilising the position of major liquid milk schemes in their markets.

* Essentially, the focus of my speech was on how food aid, when used judiciously, could become an instrument for social and economic well-being and not something that would mar and destroy that country’s self-sufficiency. I convinced the delegates that being an employee of the farmers of India I would use this aid for the good of my country, not for the good of the EEC. I warned them that I would not allow them to create by their donations a permanent market here – I would not allow them to ‘dump’ their dairy products in my country. And because I recognised that food aid is a two-edged sword I would not wield it unskillfully, thereby cutting our own throat. 

* The first of the principles was that if we wanted to produce milk, we must have a market for it and that market must be such that the person producing the commodity must profit. After our experience at Amul, we knew that we could depend on our farmers. The farmers have a long and ancient tradition behind them and a great wisdom born out of experience, and once we assure a market and a good price, they will produce. Unfortunately, our directors at animal husbandry and our directors of the milk department did not understand this fundamental principle whenever they talked of increased production; they spoke endlessly of better seeds, fertilisers, irrigation or of vaccines, Holstein semen, Jersey semen, warm semen or frozen semen and so on. None of these people ever spoke about marketing, which was so central to increased production. We at NDDB knew that there would have been no Anand unless there was a Bombay. There could be no production unless there was a market. Marketing, therefore, was the dominant orientation of the project as a whole.

* Another lesson we had already learnt at Amul was that we could not link procurement and marketing rigidly. It was true that in the case of milk we could not sell more than we collected and neither could we sell less, and therefore, the market needed to expand just that much more. However, if we had linked procurement and marketing rigidly, we would have created a situation where markets had to expand at exactly the same rate as production or procurement – which is impossible. What, for instance, would happen in summer, when the production and procurement of milk goes down? The market would not shrink to suit us. So we knew that the moment we linked the two rigidly, things would not work.

* I have always believed that once you identify the best person for a particular project and tell him or her exactly what you expect, you must put your complete trust in that person, allowing him or her to work independently without interference. If you do, the project is bound to succeed.

* Another concern that preoccupied me was that with more cooperative dairies coming up elsewhere in Gujarat, we could well be faced with a situation where milk cooperatives started competing against one another. I could not allow this to happen. In fact, in 1969, as Amul’s General Manager I had signed an agreement with the neighbouring and large cooperative dairy at Mehsana, whereby they would produce butter and milk powder under the Amul brand name and we would distribute their products through our distributors. Thus, instead of competing with each other, we would combine forces and expand our markets while saving on advertising and brand building.

* When our proposal for Operation Flood was being examined in the late 1960s, there was a serious debate about whether a country like India could – or rather, should – produce milk. Advanced dairying countries criticised us saying that here was a country which did not have enough food to eat and was importing foodgrains, whose population was growing at a phenomenal rate, and therefore, would have an increasing demand on foodgrains: in such a country, should valuable land be diverted from food production to feed production? In such a situation should we be producing milk, creating conflict between man and beast for land and its produce? The second argument was that milk was not such a necessity, after all, in terms of nutritional value. Given all these facts, asked the advanced countries, could India afford animal products, including milk? Why then should we have a programme which would stimulate milk production? I thought the criticism did have some validity. But at the same time I felt that it was also indicative of the antagonism advanced dairying countries had to any move that a developing country makes towards self-sufficiency. But the question did remain in my mind that any strategy we evolved must take into account the fact that with our agro-climatic conditions we could not give each cow or buffalo one acre of green grass, where all that the cow had to do was graze on it, morning, noon and night and produce 40 litres of milk a day. That type of dairying was obviously not for us. We simply could not afford to give every animal one acre of land when we were not giving every human being even one acre. We could not afford to keep the animals in a better shape and in better condition than our villagers. That is why we ensured that the latter stages of Operation Flood included activities that centred on research into feed, animal health and animal nutrition. Our research helped in ensuring that our milk production should come from fodder and feed which man could not eat, which was produced not specially for our animals but was produced in the process of producing food for human beings. I think in the long run we proved to our detractors, and to the world at large, that even as technical, professional people we did look at dairy development not merely as the development of milk or animal husbandry, but in all its aspects. We were keenly aware at NDDB that every new project, each fresh activity undertaken, had to fit into a holistic approach to development.

* The tragedy of India is that we frequently have no respect for Indians, for Indian efforts and for Indian successes.

* Basic social and economic change needs to be brought about gradually and the more carefully and thoughtfully it is effected, the more permanent it will be.

* Yet, when we look around, we see that we are dependent almost entirely on our political and parliamentary system for future leaders. Since these structures now seem interested only in power and money, the quality of the leadership that emerges through them is, to say the least, ignoble. Therefore, today, perhaps more than at any other period in the history of our nation, there is a dire need to create a new generation of leadership through a plurality of truly democratic structures. What we at Anand and at NDDB tried to do was to create this plurality of democratic institutions at the village level, underpinning our democratic structure in Delhi or in the state capital. It is through such democratic structures, which permeate right down to the village level, that a dynamic future leadership of this country will evolve.

* At NDDB we recognised that one of the biggest problems of Indian agriculture is that it is very difficult to fine-tune the production of an agricultural commodity exactly to match the demand. Production, being dependent on nature, will fluctuate. In such a scenario, it is easy for the traders and businessmen, whose only objective is to make money, to exploit the farmers. That is why the structure that NDDB promoted was a cooperative, non-exploitative structure, which eliminated the greedy people between those who produce the agricultural commodity and those who consume it. We believed that what worked through the Anand pattern with milk would also work for other agricultural commodities.

* I was just twenty-eight years old when Tribhuvandas made me the General Manager of Amul. It is an age when one believes nothing is impossible and one is ready to take on challenges. I believed in entrusting professionals with responsibilities at an early age, encouraging them to take initiatives, and correcting them when things went wrong, instead of penalising or condemning them.

* While integrity and loyalty are core values, there are other values, too, which are a prerequisite to achieve success in any field. For example, the leader has to set a personal example and make others understand in what ways ‘change’ is going to be useful. I believe that professionals working in our organisations must have a clarity of thought combined with a passionate pursuit of mastery of their subject. I have always emphasised that large endeavours are only the sum of many small parts and, therefore, we must keep in mind not just where we are going but how we are going to reach there successfully.

* I also believe that a person who does not have respect for time, and does not have a sense of timing can achieve little.

* What is the primary job of an efficient manager? In my book, it is to bring in and groom the right people on the team. Once this is done, the manager must then groom the successor most appropriate for the institution.

* It is now over a decade since India embarked upon its journey of liberalisation and globalisation. In the days that have followed, most of our cooperatives have learnt to cope with three distinct disadvantages that a liberalising economy has conferred on them. Firstly, our cooperatives have learnt to develop without the benefits earlier available to them in a mixed economy. Secondly, our cooperatives have learnt to perform in the market place even though the shift to a free market economy has mainly benefited large capital, whether Indian or foreign. Thirdly, even though the labyrinth of rules and controls that regulate cooperatives remain generally unchanged, our cooperatives are finding innovative strategies to achieve their goals.

* The dairy cooperatives have managed all this because they have done three crucial things. They have acquired and equipped themselves with the latest and most modern technology for milk processing and product manufacture. Then they have defined the standards necessary to achieve and maintain world-class quality. And, most importantly, they have put in place systems which will ensure that they consistently achieve the standards they have set for themselves.

* Yet, if there is one conviction I hold as firmly today as I did fifty years ago and if there is one reason why I must remain optimistic about our nation’s future, it is because I have seen over and over again that when the tools of development are placed in the hands of our rural people, and when their energy and wisdom is linked with the skill of committed professionals, there is nothing they cannot achieve.
