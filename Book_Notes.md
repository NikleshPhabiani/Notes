## The Millionaire Next Door - Thomas Stanley and William Danko
* Common denominators among those who successfully build wealth:
  * Live below their means
  * Allocate time, money, and energy, in ways conducive to building wealth
  * Financial independence is more important than displaying high social status
  * Parents do not provide economic outpatient care
  * Their adult children are economically self-sufficient
  * Proficient in targeting market opportunities
  * Chose the right occupation
  
* **Wealthy (Definition)**: One who gets more pleasure from owning substantial amounts of appreciable assets than from displaying a high-consumption lifestyle

* **Expected Net worth** = (Age x Pretax annual income / 10)

* Great offense: Earn High; Great Defense: Accumulate High (Frugal)

  The way to outperform is through great defense, and this is possible through budgeting and planning (time and energy).

* **Strategy for nunbudgeter millionaires**: Create an environment of relative scarcity i.e invest from their annual before they pay the sellers for their food, clothes, home, credit, etc.

* To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income, and maximize your unrealized income (wealth / capital appreciation without a cash flow)

* Never purchase a home with a mortgage that is more than 2x your household's annual realized income

* Begin earning and investing early in your adult life

* Wealth is more often the result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and, most of all, self-discipline

* Choose a financial advisor who is endorsed by an enlightened accountant and/or his clients with investment portfolios that in the long run outpace the market. If you don’t have an accountant, hire one. To find a high-quality accountant, ask friends or associates who fit the PAW profile. You may wish to call the accounting department at your state’s university. Speak with several accounting faculty. Ask them for the names of their former students who have established track records in helping clients make enlightened financial decisions. Another method is to call the local offices of national accounting firms, which are often very selective in their hiring. Even large firms have many smaller accounting/financial planning clients. We selected our CPAs based on two criteria. First, the CPAs were recommended by professors of accounting. Second, the CPAs were initially hired out of college by major accounting firms and later started their own successful accounting firms. We find that many of the very best CPAs and financial planners follow this career path.

## The Happiness Advantage - Shawn Achor

* Cultivating positive brains makses us more motivated, efficient, resilient, creative, and productive, which drives performance upward

* If we study merely what is average, we will remain merely average. Don't make the error of the average i.e don't always try and get to the average. This links to not removing the outliers, and rather learn from them.

* What we spend our time and mental energy focusing on can indeed become our reality

* Brains are hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative or neutral, but when they are positive

* Seven principles that predict success and achievement
  * **The Happiness Advantage**: Positive brains have more biological advantage over negative or neutral brains
  
  * **The Fulcrum and the Lever**: The way we experience the world, and the ability to succeed in it changes based on our         mindset. This principle teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (lever) to be     more fulfilled and successful.
  
  * **The Tetris Effect**: When our brain gets stuck in a pattern that focuses on stress, negativity, and failure, we set     
    ourselves to fail. This principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to spot patters of posibility, so we can seize the
    opportunities around us.
    
  * **Falling Up**: This principle is about finding the mental path that not only leads us up out of failure or suffering, 
    but teaches us to be happier and more successful because of it.
     
  * **The Zorro Circle**: When challenges loom and we get overwhelmed, our rational brains can get hijacked by emotions. This
    principle teaches us how to regain control by focusing first on small, manageable goals, and then gradually expanding our
    circles to achieve bigger and bigger ones.
     
  * **The 20-second Rule**: Sustaining lasting change often feels impossible since our willpower is limited. When our 
    willpower fails, we fall back to out old habits, and succumb to the path of least resistance. This principle shows, how
    by making small energy adjustments, we can reroute the path of least resistance and replace bad habits with good ones.
     
  * **Social Investment**: In the midst of challenges and stress, we choose to hunker down and retreat within ourselves. 
    However, the most successful people invest in their friends, peers and family members to propel themselves forward. This 
    principle teaches us how to invest more in one of the greates predictors of success and excellence - our social support 
    network.

* Happiness is not a belief that we don't need to change, it is the realization that we can

* Don't look at happiness as some distant reward for achievements. Rather, capitalize on the positive and reap the rewards at 
  every turn.
  
* Happiness is the joy we feel striving after our potential
 
* Positive emotions flood our brains with dopamine and serotonin, chemicals that not only make us feel good, but dial up the 
  learning centers of our brains to higher levels. It helps us organize new information, keep that info in the brain longer,
  and retrieve it faster
   
* **Medical anchoring**: Occurs when a doctor has trouble letting go of an initial diagonosis (anchor point), even in the 
  face of new information that contradicts the initial theory.
  
* Positive emotions provide a quick and powerful antidote to stress and anxiety, which in turn improves our focus and our 
  ability to function at the best level.
  
* **Some ways to put yourself in a positive mindset**:
  * Meditate
  * Find something to look forward to
  * Commit conscious acts of kindness
  * Infuse positivity in your surroundings
  * Exercise
  * Spend money on doing and not having
  * Exercise a signature strength
  
* Sacrificing positivity in the name of time management and efficiency actually slows us down

* **Some ways to spread positive mindset**:
  * Talk about someone in the company who deserves recognition (Basically words of appreciation make a huge difference)
  * A small token of appreciation from one person to another
  
* The mental contruction of our faily activities, more than the activity itself, defines our reality

* Believe in your abilities, and focus on your strengths when assigned a challenging task

* Scanning the world for negatives undercuts our creativity, raises our stress levels, and lowers the motivation and ability
  to accomplish goals
  
* Perform the *Three Good Things* Exercise daily

* **Counterfact**: An alternate scenario our brain creates to help us evaluate and make sense of what really happened

* Learn the ABCD (Adversity, Belief, Consequence, Disputation)

* Activation energy is the initial spark needed to catalyze a reaction. The same energy, both physical and mental is needed 
  of people to overcome inertia and kick-start a positive habit. Otherwise, we end up going down on a path of least  
  resistance.
  
* Lower the activation energy for the habits that you want to adobt, and raise it for the ones you want to avoid. The more we 
  lower the activation energy for our desired actions, the more we enhance our ability to jump-start positive change.
  
* Studies show that the more team members are encouraged to socialize and interact face-to-face, the more engaged they feel, 
  the more energy they have, and the longer they can stay focused on a task.
  
## Atomic Habits - James Clear

* A habit is a routine or a behavior performed regularly, and in many cases automatically

* Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results when you stick with them for years

* You get what you repeat

* Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your 
  ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
  
* Habits need to persist long enough to break the Plateau of Latent Potential, in which the initial growth is very slow, and 
  once you cross the threshold, you see remarkable results.
  
* Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are the processes that lead to those results.

* Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are good for making progress.

* Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves

* The purpose of goals is to win the game. The purpose of systems is to keep playing the game. True long-term thinking is 
  goal-less thinking. It is a cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.
  
* You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

* Changing habits is challenging because:
  * We try to change the wrong thing
  * We try to change our habits in the wrong way

*
