## The Millionaire Next Door - Thomas Stanley and William Danko
* Common denominators among those who successfully build wealth:
  * Live below their means
  * Allocate time, money, and energy, in ways conducive to building wealth
  * Financial independence is more important than displaying high social status
  * Parents do not provide economic outpatient care
  * Their adult children are economically self-sufficient
  * Proficient in targeting market opportunities
  * Chose the right occupation
  
* **Wealthy (Definition)**: One who gets more pleasure from owning substantial amounts of appreciable assets than from displaying a high-consumption lifestyle

* **Expected Net worth** = (Age x Pretax annual income / 10)

* Great offense: Earn High; Great Defense: Accumulate High (Frugal)

  The way to outperform is through great defense, and this is possible through budgeting and planning (time and energy).

* **Strategy for nunbudgeter millionaires**: Create an environment of relative scarcity i.e invest from their annual before they pay the sellers for their food, clothes, home, credit, etc.

* To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income, and maximize your unrealized income (wealth / capital appreciation without a cash flow)

* Never purchase a home with a mortgage that is more than 2x your household's annual realized income

* Begin earning and investing early in your adult life

* Wealth is more often the result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and, most of all, self-discipline

* Choose a financial advisor who is endorsed by an enlightened accountant and/or his clients with investment portfolios that in the long run outpace the market. If you don’t have an accountant, hire one. To find a high-quality accountant, ask friends or associates who fit the PAW profile. You may wish to call the accounting department at your state’s university. Speak with several accounting faculty. Ask them for the names of their former students who have established track records in helping clients make enlightened financial decisions. Another method is to call the local offices of national accounting firms, which are often very selective in their hiring. Even large firms have many smaller accounting/financial planning clients. We selected our CPAs based on two criteria. First, the CPAs were recommended by professors of accounting. Second, the CPAs were initially hired out of college by major accounting firms and later started their own successful accounting firms. We find that many of the very best CPAs and financial planners follow this career path.

## The Happiness Advantage - Shawn Achor

* Cultivating positive brains makses us more motivated, efficient, resilient, creative, and productive, which drives performance upward

* If we study merely what is average, we will remain merely average. Don't make the error of the average i.e don't always try and get to the average. This links to not removing the outliers, and rather learn from them.

* What we spend our time and mental energy focusing on can indeed become our reality

* Brains are hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative or neutral, but when they are positive

* Seven principles that predict success and achievement
  * **The Happiness Advantage**: Positive brains have more biological advantage over negative or neutral brains
  
  * **The Fulcrum and the Lever**: The way we experience the world, and the ability to succeed in it changes based on our         mindest. This principle teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (lever) to be     more fulfilled and successful.
  
  * **The Tetris Effect**: When our brain gets stuck in a pattern that focuses on stress, negativity, and failure, we set     
    ourselves to fail. This principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to spot patters of posibility, so we can seize the
    opportunities around us.
