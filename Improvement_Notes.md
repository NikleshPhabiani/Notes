## Four Habits of Discipline

* **Take one thing at a time**

  Don't get intimidated by big tasks. Break them into small pieces, and tackle one at a time.

* **Be detail-oriented**

  Put your time and energy into details. Do the tasks right or don't do it at all.
  Learn this by making your bed in a detailed way.

* **Exercise regularly**

  Sound mind starts with a sound body.

* **Start early**

  It gives a feeling of preemptive strike when you get up before the rest of the world. Follow this on all days
  since the body loves regimen and repitition.
